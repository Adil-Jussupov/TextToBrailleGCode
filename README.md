# TextToBrailleGCode
Converts text to GCode for embossing that text in Braille on 3d printer

These project aims to make process of going to restaurants and food courts more accessible for visually impaired community.
Nowadays, there is a huge gap in providing accessible menus in restaurants for visually impaired people. We want to produce restaurant menus in Braille on a silicon sheets. It is a way more durable, reusable and washable way of providing information in Braille rather than traditional paper Braille. Also, because silicone sheet is reusable, this approach is more sustainable.
